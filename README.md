# Specter

`Specter` is a wrapper for [webrtc.rs](https://webrtc.rs) as an Elixir NIF, using
Rustler.

This library is a low-level interface to the data structures and
entities provided by Rust, with a minimal set of opinions.


## Installation

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:specter, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Development

Development of `Specter` depends on Elixir, Erlang, and Rust being available
in the environment. Suggested setup:

```shell
asdf plugin-add erlang
asdf plugin-add elixir
asdf plugin-add rust

bin/dev/doctor
```

CI will run tests and audit the repository, but to make sure all checks locally,
the following commands can be run:

```shell
bin/dev/audit
bin/dev/test
```

The following script is encouraged to run all checks as a part of pushing commits:

```shell
bin/dev/shipit
```
